## Easy way to create and share a sparring format

To create and share the specific rules for your sparring session easily with others you can create a simple code in a specific format. The code consists of two sections - `Equipment` section and `Technical Arsenal` section. Both sections are separated by a `|` a.k.a. the pipe character. Each section can contain one or more options provided by the guidelines chained with a dash `-`.
